  <h3>Multitouch Bug Test</h3>

  <p>Many older Android devices, generally those shipped with Froyo (2.2) or earlier, have
  a significant bug in how multiple touch points (e.g. "multitouch") are handled.</p>

  <p>This program is designed to demonstrate.</p>

  <h4>Performing the Test</h4>

  <p>Touch the screen several times at once.  You should see a circle appear at each touch point,
  along with the ID number of the touch point, as reported by Android.  As you hold a touch point,
  that point's ID number should not change.</p>

  <p>On buggy devices, if you touch #1, touch #2, then while holding #2, lift and tap #1
  repeatedly, you will notice the numbers on the two touch points swapping back and forth.
  This confirms the bug.</p>
